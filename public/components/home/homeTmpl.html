      <p>
        Cerulean Storm is a content-sharing website created for artists, by artists. Our goal is to create a space where musical artists, fiction writers, and digital artists can share and promote their work. Cerulean Storm also allows artists to sell their works through the site to other people online. We offer a forum where artists of all backgrounds can share new ideas and promote a community.
